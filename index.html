                <p>Lifelong improvement in your golf game starts with setting meaningful, high-quality goals. Many golfers set goals that
                sound great but are often unrealistic:</p>
                <p>&bull; "I am going to be a scratch golfer!"</p>
                <p>&bull; "I am going to shoot my age!"</p>
                <p>The reality is that unless you are in the top 1 - 3% of golfers, these goals may be out of reach.</p>
                <p>Instead, challenge yourself with a goal that is both ambitious and achievable - become a Decade Shooter! Aim to shoot
                your decade and track your progress over time.</p>
